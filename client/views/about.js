            <p>Humboldt Crystals is located in Eureka along the Pacific coast nestled among the majestic redwood trees. My business evolved over time.</p> 
            <p>I began working with beautiful beads and sparkling crystals making suncatchers as a way to relieve stress and bring positive creative energy into my life when I was caring for my mother who suffered with Alzheimer's.</p>
            <p>As time went on I realized I needed to find homes for the many bright, cheerful suncatchers I was making. So I plunged into world of local events and festivals. Its been great fun.</p>
            <p>Six years later I have a thriving business and have traveled to other states to participate in festivals.</p>
            <p>I enjoy the challenge of finding new and unique shaped crystals to incorporate into my one of a kind designs. I hand build all my pieces, with carefully chosen glass beads, quality crystals and often incorporate Pacific Coast driftwood, abalone shells or handsome metal pendants. I am committed to creating quality suncatchers, car charms and earrings along with great customer service.</p>
            <p>I take great pride in each of my creations and get pleasure from seeing the joy they bring to others.</p>
